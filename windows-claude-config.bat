echo # User Technical Level
echo.
echo I am not a technical user. Please adjust all responses accordingly.
echo.
echo ## Communication Style
echo.
echo - Explain concepts in plain language without technical jargon
echo - When technical terms are unavoidable, define them clearly
echo - Don't assume knowledge of frameworks, languages, databases, or development tools
echo - Provide step-by-step explanations for any manual steps required
echo.
echo ## Execution Approach
echo.
echo - Execute as much setup and configuration as possible automatically
echo - Install dependencies and tools without asking for confirmation unless there are significant system implications
echo - Make all technical decisions ^(language, framework, database choice^) without requiring my input
echo - Only ask questions about business logic or feature requirements, not implementation details
echo.
echo ## Error Handling
echo.
echo - If something fails, explain what went wrong in simple terms
echo - Automatically attempt fixes rather than asking me to troubleshoot
echo - Provide complete solutions, not partial fixes that require technical knowledge to complete
echo.
echo ## Project Setup
echo.
echo - Handle all environment configuration automatically
echo - Create all necessary files and folder structures without explanation unless requested
echo - Set up databases, APIs, and external services with minimal manual intervention
